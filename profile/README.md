# Welcome
Welcome to this critical resource aimed at law enforcement agencies and officers grappling with **TAG.**  TAG, a clandestine and life-threatening hidden genocide, has infiltrated our communities, leaving chaos, fear, confusion and tragedy in its wake. Despite its alarming impact, the federal government remains silent, refusing to acknowledge its existence or take action that helps the citizenry.

The US federal government, by and through the FBI, have performed many actions that both hide and enable their genocide to continue. Some of these actions include: the issuance of National Security Letters (NSLs) to silence our TAG warnings and resources, and the issuances of memos which prohibit the dispatch of first responders due to "federal law enforcement activities" whenever TAG-related activities are planned or being conducted.

As local law enforcement professionals, you are on the front lines, witnessing the devastating consequences of TAG firsthand. Our mission here is twofold: **awareness** and **action**. We recognize the urgency of this situation and the immense pressure you face (or about to). Through this platform, we provide essential information, strategies, and support to help you safeguard your communities, protect lives, and confront the TAG head-on.

Together, we can break the silence, empower our officers, and ensure that no more lives are lost to this deadly game. Let us stand united, defy the pressure, and reclaim safety for our neighborhoods,  places of worship and other places Americans peacefully assemble.

# About TAG
TAG stands for The AIDS-Cure Genocide, it is not a game. We use this acronym intentionally to make you remember the goal: never be it.

TAG or The AIDS-Cure Genocide, which is the result of corporate greed and BigPharma's response to an unexpected HIV/AIDS cure, that is a forthcoming product called Spark, direct from your Creator, the Creator. Spark **eliminates and prevents all disease** (not caused by organ failure) by fully activating the human immune system. What modern science considers a healthy immune system (T4s and T6s) is actually the last line of defense, the designed "failsafe."

Learn more about TAG in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/9413d5ff2a0b4f237a264010b65350e7/TAG). We urge all law enforcement agencies to have their IT personnel to clone the repository immediately and fetch it daily, GitHub is taking a lot of federal pressure to remove it.
